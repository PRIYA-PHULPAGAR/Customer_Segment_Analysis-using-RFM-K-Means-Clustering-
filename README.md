# Customer Segment Analysis using RFM & K-Means Clustering

# Overview

This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-Means clustering. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to optimize marketing strategies and business decisions.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of customer transactions, including details such as purchase date, purchase frequency, and transaction amount. Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.

# Methodology

The analysis follows these key steps:

* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.

* RFM Analysis: Calculating Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores for each customer.

* Clustering with K-Means: Applying K-Means clustering to segment customers based on RFM scores.

* Visualization & Interpretation: Understanding cluster characteristics through visualizations.

# Technologies Used

* Python

* Jupyter Notebook

* Pandas, NumPy

* Scikit-Learn

* Matplotlib, Seaborn

# Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:


# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
